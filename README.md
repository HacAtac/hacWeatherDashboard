<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Dealing with Server-Side APIs and third-party APIs this has taught me a ton!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>First I've made HTML with form inputs</li>
    <li>Then I've used One Call API to show current and future conditions for searched city.</li>
    <li>Then that city is added to the search history</li>
    <li>Once city is searched I've made it show icon representation of conditions, the temp, the humidity, wind speed, UV index</li>
    <li>Then made the UV index show background color of how moderate to severe it is.</li>
    <li>Then I've made an event listener for all searched cities that will populate again.</li>
    <li>I've implemented local storage for all inputs and also looped the object to populate searches on refresh.</li>
  </ul>
